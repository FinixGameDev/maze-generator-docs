# Installation
[Finix's Maze Generator](../README.md) is fully self contained and does not depend on any external assets. If you do not need the sample scenes, standard prefabs or the triplanar shader, feel free to exclude the art and resources folder when importing the package.

Keep in mind that for a walls and pillars instatiation the walls will be stretched to fit the maze size, as such the UVs will also be stretched, it is reccomended to use the included standard triplanar shader for the walls or other similar implementation.
